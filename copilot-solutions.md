# Solutions for added challenges

This document captures the clues and example SQL queries used to solve the challenges including the classic SQL Murder Mystery.

## SQL Murder Mystery I

### Clues

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database.

Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

## SQL Murder Mystery II

### Clues

Another crime has occurred and the detective needs your help once again. You've been handed a case file, but some crucial details are missing.
You remember that the crime was a murder that occurred on Jan.14, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City.
The victim was found at the Get Fit Now gym, and witnesses were present during the incident. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database.

A murder occurred at Get Fit Now gym. Victim found in locker room at 6 AM.
Security cameras captured two witnesses: gym member with brown hair, 70 inches tall, driving Honda Civic, and someone with license plate WHT789.
Check their interview transcripts for what they saw.

I was doing cardio when I heard shouting from the locker room around 11:20 PM. I saw Ryan arguing with someone from behind. The person was tall, around 68 inches, with black hair. They seemed upset about business. I heard "keep your mouth shut about money!"

I witnessed part of the fight. I saw a man arguing with Ryan - he drove a black Dodge Charger. The guy looked young, maybe late twenties, upset about finances. The argument got heated before they went to the locker room. I left after.

I had issues with Ryan over our supplement business. He threatened to expose irregularities to authorities.
I went to confront him but didn't kill him! Someone else pulled the strings.
A woman from Elm Street at the Business Networking Mixer knew about my debts and had money to burn. She drives a BMW.

## Cyberpunk Mystery I

### Clues

In the neon-lit sprawl of Neo-Tokyo, a high-tech heist has shaken the corporate elite.
The AI Core has been stolen from the secure vault on February 20, 2147.
Dive into the database to uncover the hacker, the insider, and the mastermind behind this cyberpunk conspiracy. Below is the schema diagram for this database.

The AI Core was stolen from the secure vault. Security drones detected a hacker with 5 neural implants, using a Neural Deck, with over 3 anomalies, in Sector 7 on February 20, 2147.

I broke into the vault. The insider who paid me 30000 in CryptoByte, used Access Implant cyberware, and was spotted in Sector 7 is the one who gave me the codes to get in.

I was just doing my job, but I saw the big boss who had 4 neural implants, paid the hacker 50000 in NeoCoin, and was operating out of Corporate on 21470220. I think that's all I know.

## Cyberpunk Mystery II

### Clues

Aegis Station went dark and the quantum failsafe failed. You vaguely remember that the incident happened on March 1, 2147,
and that an AI was moved into a ghost drive during the blackout. Start by finding the incident briefing from that date,
then follow the movement, device, and payment records until you can identify the runner, the insider, and the mastermind.

Failsafe collapsed at 21:09; vault scanners caught a Ghost Deck with six anomalies exiting toward Sector 9.
The runner is a Neural Broker based in Sector 9. Implant sync records show no sync for 10+ days (last sync on or before the 20th of February).

The buyer used a cloned clearance badge. Payment was exactly 45,000 SpectraCoin on March 1, 2147. Next, find the Security Chief on Core Deck with a Clearance Lattice implant.

The operation was funded by TWO payouts to the same person: 50,000 NeoCoin and 20,000 LuminaCredit.
The payer is a Lead Scientist in the Research Ring with four implants. Find who matches all of that.

## Cyberpunk Mystery III

### Clues

The Mirror Array in Neo-Tokyo was hijacked during a blackout, and the case file is missing the key specifics. You remember that the incident was a breach that occurred on March 12, 2147 and that it took place in Sector 6. Start by retrieving the incident report to recover the details, then use device telemetry, implant records, and interrogation logs to identify the runner, the insider, and the executive sponsor.

Mirror Array breach in Sector 6. Twin telemetry signatures detected: a Ghost Deck with six anomalies and a Neural Deck with four anomalies. The runner is a Neural Broker with five implants; last implant sync on or before March 1, 2147.

I ran the Mirror Array job, but I did not plan it. The buyer used a cloned clearance badge and paid exactly 45,000 SpectraCoin. They were a Security Chief on Core Deck with Clearance Lattice and Command Mesh implants.

The sponsor was a Corporate Exec using a Command Unit device that logged exactly two anomalies, and they had a Directive Stack implant.

## Undersea Mystery I

### Clues

A replacement pump never arrived, and the station is humming a worried tune after an alleged theft. Start by finding the incident report from July 18, 2091, then use that report's details to identify the onsite actor, the handler who filed the manifest edit, and the senior engineer who approved the overrides.

A replacement pump went missing. It was labeled as a Type-K coolant crate during the 05:00–06:00 intake window in Intake Bay A. The label swapper was a Cargo Handler who gained access to Intake Bay A twice during that window.

I swapped the label, but I did not plan it. A Logistics Tech in Module C-1 told me to do it and filed a manifest edit ticket for shipment 7002.

The request came from a Senior Engineer who approved two expedite overrides for Intake Bay A between July 15 and July 21, 2091.

## Undersea Mystery II

### Clues

Deep Horizon Station experienced catastrophic life support failure, and you've been handed an incomplete case file.
You vaguely remember that the incident was a sabotage that occurred on August 25, 2091 in Module D-7.
Start by retrieving the incident report from the station's database. The report mentions two witnesses who were present during the critical window.
Find them, interview them, and follow the evidence chain to identify both the perpetrator and the mastermind behind the sabotage.

Life support failure at 03:45. Two witnesses identified: Maintenance Tech from Module D-7 with most accesses 03:00-04:00, and Systems Engineer from Module E-2 with 2 Module D-7 diagnostic reports on 8/25.

I was running diagnostics in Module D-7 when I heard someone tampering with the oxygen recycler. I saw a Senior Tech with a specialized bypass tool kit. They had accessed the Security Hub the night before at 22:00 on August 24. The person was also involved in exactly 4 override approvals for safety systems in Module D-7 during the week of August 20-26, 2091. They seemed very familiar with the safety protocols.

I was monitoring systems remotely from Module E-2 when alerts started flooding in. I traced the bypass commands to a Senior Tech account. After cross-referencing, I found they had submitted exactly 3 equipment requisition work orders for Module D-7 between August 20 and August 26. The pattern suggested someone with deep system knowledge and premeditated access.

Look, I did the technical work, but I was following orders. The Station Director who authorized this has been on-station for years. They approved exactly 5 critical system overrides between August 15 and August 25, all for Module D-7. They also filed exactly 2 emergency protocol work orders for Command Center during that same period. The paper trail is there - they signed off on everything and made it look routine.
