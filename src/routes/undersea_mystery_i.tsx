          A replacement pump never arrived, and the station is humming a worried tune after an alleged <strong>theft</strong>
          . Begin by locating the incident report dated <strong>July 18, 2091</strong>. Once you have the report, comb
          through its timeline and attachments to extract the onsite actor involved, the cargo handler who submitted the
          manifest edit, and the senior engineer who signed off on the override approvals. Pay close attention to timestamps
          and change notes, they often reveal the chain of responsibility and small inconsistencies that point to the real
          culprit.
