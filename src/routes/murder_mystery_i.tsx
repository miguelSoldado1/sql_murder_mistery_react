          A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you
          somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the <strong>crime was a murder</strong> that occurred sometime on
          <strong> Jan.15, 2018</strong> and that <strong>it took place in SQL City</strong>. Start by retrieving the
          corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. Below is the schema diagram for this
          database.
