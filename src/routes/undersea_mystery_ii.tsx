          Deep Horizon Station experienced catastrophic life support failure, and you&apos;ve been handed an incomplete case
          file. You vaguely remember that the incident was a <strong>sabotage</strong> that occurred on{" "}
          <strong>August 25, 2091</strong> in <strong>Module D-7</strong>. Start by retrieving the incident report from the
          station&apos;s database. The report mentions two witnesses who were present during the critical window. Find them,
          interview them, and follow the evidence chain to identify both the perpetrator and the mastermind behind the
          sabotage.
